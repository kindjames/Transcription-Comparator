Group 1: Kath
ANIMAL: (35.7)
The bravest (.) animal (.8) that’s actually a pretty hard ↑question. (.4) Um: (.4) I ↑guess (EM) the bravest animal would probably be: (1.2) something that (.) lives in the ↑ocean because (DIR) the ocean is a very scary place. (.5) Um: (.9) especially: because there are (.5) a lot of things that live deep under the water that will kill you ((laughs)). (1.1) Um so I ↑guess (EM) being like (1.3) a fish or: a dolphin (.3) would be very brave (.2) because you don’t know what’s below you and it could just come up and eat you.

LEADER: (32.6)
Um (DIR) a good leader is (.4) ↑empathetic (.4) and: understands (.5) um what’s important (.) and: how to make that happen. (.2) Um they think (.7) more about an: end goal (.4) rather than thinking about themselves (.) exclusively (.7) um (1.0) and: a good leader is also usually very ↑organized and good at planning (.9) and: (.5) good at keeping track of what other people ↑need.

SCHOOL: (29.4)
Um the hardest school subject (.6) um: (.2) I ↑guess (EM) the hardest school subject is history because you just have to memorize a bunch of things and you can’t think about it logically (.6) um: (.4) so you kind of just have to remember things even if they’re boring (.7) um (.3) and you also have to memorize a lot of (.) pointless things like dates so it’s (.) um (DIR) it’s hard to pay attention or (.3) care very much about the majority of it.

SECOND LANG: (26.1)
Um I ↑think (EM) learning a second language is: (.6) ↑good (.) for your ↑brain because it helps you establish different thought patterns (.6) and: um (DIR) it’s also (.3) good for you physiologically because you (.5) learn how to make different sounds with your vocal cords and your mouth (.6) and: (.2) um it also can help you think in news ways because there are cultural differences between languages um.

SPACE: (30.9)
(DIR) Space travel is: (.4) uh: a pretty cool thing to think about. (.9) I don’t ↑know how realistic it is but I (.4) ↑think that (EM) it would be pretty cool to (.5) take a space ship and: fly through space and see nebulas (.5) and: see other planets but I think (DM) (.8) that landing on another planet would be pretty scary because you might not be able to breathe (.2) the ↑air and there could be (.4) aliens there would want to eat you.

STORY: (26.3)
Uh stories are interesting (.2) if they have ↑mystery and (.7) um they build up for a long time and then they (.9) uh have some suspense ((laughs)) and then they reach um (.4) ↑climax and you find out (.8) the suspenseful thing that you’ve been waiting for and then (.) um (.6) you: (1.2) have fun listening to it.

SUMMER: (24.0)
In the summer (DIR) it’s good to go up north because if you go south it’s too hot (.6) um and too sunny (.4) so (DIR) going up north is good because you get the perfect temperature (.2) and: good weather (.) and: (1.0) if you go up north you also will get to a ↑lake and you can go swimming in it and that’s (1.0) nice and cool: so you have a good (.2) mixture of hot air and cool water.

TV: (32.1)
Um I ↑think (EM) most current TV shows are pretty boring (.9) especially reality shows because they’re usually capitalizing off of (.5) people who (.) um are like experiencing (.3) a negative situation (.8) um (.9) and: most mainstream TV is not very well written and relies a lot on (.6) boring humor and (1.0) laugh tracks and (.9) (DIR) there are too many commercials.

VEG: (18.9)
(DIR) Being a vegetarian is a good ↑thing because: (DIR) eating animals is bad and they don’t taste (.4) very good (.4) and (DIR) it’s also sad to kill them because they: (1.3) have feelings and it’s not nice to k- ca- (.) keep them ↑captive and then murder them and steal their (.3) meat.

CHARLOTTE 1: (30.7)
Um I ↑guess (EM) Charlotte is gonna need to replan her party so that she can have it on Friday. (.6) Um either that or she could call everybody she ↑invited (.) and: tell them that she made a mistake on the invitations (.10) um: (.8) or: (.5) she could send out new invitations with the right date. (.7) Um: (1.7) but either way that really sucks and hopefully she learns her lesson and double checks all her invitations in the future.

CHARLOTTE 2: (23.0)
She ↑could: (.) uh she should call (.3) ↑up all of her friends and family that she invited to the party (.2) and tell them to come on (.3) Saturday (.6) or she could send out new invitations for everybody (1.1) or: (.9) she: could (.2) potentially um: (.6) post about it on facebook (.5) um.

CHARLOTTE 3: (33.8)
Um it sounds like Charlotte is probably very ↑busy or: maybe is (.2) um a little distracted (.7) or: maybe stressed out by something: ↑else (.) um: (6) and maybe has too much going on if she doesn’t have time to read her invitations before she mails ↑them. (1.1) Um (.7) I feel (.2) pretty ↑bad for her that she: addressed them and sent them all out with the wrong date (1.1) um: (.3) but (.) I also understand how busy you can be and sometimes you don’t have time to double ↑check things.

GARY 1: (33.9)
Um ↑Gary sounds like (.9) kind of a jerk. (.5) Um: he: (.7) wait I can’t remember which person it was that slept in. (.8) It was Gary? Okay yeah so ↑Gary should (.2) ↑probably call his friend and apologize (.7) and: (1.1) either: find out if (.8) Jake is (.5) available to have breakfast on a different ↑day (.) or: (.4) find out (.3) if he can still go to breakfast and if he doesn’t have enough time then Gary should feel bad.

GARY 2: (24.6)
Well Gary could set an alarm (.2) or he could set (.7) a few alarms. (.3) That’s usually what Trevor does to get up on time. He usually sets like (.4) ten alarms to go off (.4) in like ten minutes (.) so like (.3) one alarm goes off every minute (.7) and then: it’s really horrible for ↑me but (.) it’s good for ↑him because he wakes up on time (.6) um: (.3) so Gary should maybe try doing that ((laughs)).

GARY 3: (27.6)
Um I ↑feel like (EM) (.) Gary probably (.2) either forgot that he had (.6) um: (.4) a breakfast ↑planned (.4) or: else he maybe drank too much the night ↑before and was hung over and overslept. (.7) Um (.) either that or he probably (.5) got distracted doing something and stayed up too late (.2) um: (.2) but (.5) either way my impression is that he probably doesn’t care very much about his friend.

JIMMY 1: (25.7)
Uh ↑Jimmy sounds (.) like he’s probably (.7) pretty ↑young (.2) either that or: has pretty (.5) um concrete thinking and should probably (.6) start being taught to think more abstractly. (.4) Um: (.8) he sou- sounds like he’s probably a very little kid who’s still thinking um in black and white.

JIMMY 2: (28.8)
Jimmy’s father could: (.8) come up with a better reason why it’s ↑raining (.) like (.9) explain that the clouds are: (.2) very full of water and very heavy um (.6) so that the condensation (.7) causes the rain to fall (.) um (.2) or he could explain more about the water cycle. (.9) Um: (.6) I’m kind of surprised that Jimmy has never seen (.4) a cloudy day before when it wasn’t raining.

JIMMY 3: (25.7)
My impression of Jimmy is that (.3) uh he’s not very ↑observant. (.7) Um: (1.0) He probably (.5) only noticed it was raining because he probably got wet from the rain or something. (.7) Um: (1.7) he- he: (.) sounds like a curious person ↑now which is good and hopefully he keeps asking questions like that and wondering ((more about)) (.6) how the world worked.


Group 1: Ezra
Animal: (29.7)
Ooh I’m not ↑sure if bravery really is a concept that ↑applies to animals. Um [laughs] because: bravery involves knowing the consequences of your actions and if an animal doesn’t ↑really know the conseque- I ↑guess (EM) you could say that maybe an animal like a bee that is willing to give uh its life for the life of the hive (1.0) that’s- if you impose human psychology on the bee than that would be brave.

Leader: (37.0)
These are tough questions. Um [clears throat] I ↑think (EM) a- a good leader is able to: um see a lot of different aspects of a project and know when things- the ↑resources are not being allocated correctly towards those something I’m not very good at [laughs]. But I’ve learned since I had to start directing projects like that annotation project for ↑instance um is and ↑also be able to motivate people so being able to get people on board with your vision of it.

School: (31.6)
Uh I ↑think (EM) that could be very different for different people so um a lot of people complain obviously about math (1.0) um but I ↑think they maybe they’re: (1.1) giving themselves short shrift because I think that people probably can do math a lot better (.4) than they ↑think they can. Um other people are much worse at other subjects.

Second Lang: (27.2)
Um: my opinion on it that makes it sound like it’s sort of a moral thing. (.7) Um (.8) I ↑think that (EM) learning another language is very important for people’s development. Um (.6) that’s why they do it in-in in school. And it’s also important for: learning about other cultures I think (DM). Um but it’s also just introduces you to a new way of ↑thinking a new way of speaking and you can learn something about your own language too.

Space: (30.7)
Oh (.3) I’m (.) uh very excited for space travel in the future. (.8) Um (.7) I dunno it would be exciting to see if they ever get a project together to go to Mars in our lifetime. S- I think that would be really cool. (.4) I’m ↑assuming you mean space travel by humans. (.3) What would be ↑really exciting in the (.) far future would be if you could go (.9) um much faster like faster than ↑light or um (.) things like that explore other parts of the universe cause there’s so much out there (.3) that’s not (.5) in our neighborhood.

Story: (31.4)
Um ↑I think (MC) a story is interesting when it has some tension in it. (.7) So there’s some sort of co-↑conflict that (.) who come from any (.) source that needs to be worked through. (.6) Um usually (.3) good stories have a beginning and a middle and an end (.8) uh unlike this ↑answer [laughs]. So um (1.0) the story also will have (.4) uh: (.7) uh (.3) some excitement some uh fun use of language some (.5) imagery.

Summer: (21.1)
Oh (1.3) this is (.4) I ↑think (EM) uh (.) again there’s a lot of good places to travel in the summer. (.) Tuscany, for instance. (.6) Um (.) I (.) definitely like going to ↑Europe. (.3) cause they have lots of (.5) old and (.) beautiful things to look at and the culture’s really cool and they have good food. (.5) But ↑you could also just go somewhere nearby.

TV: (21.5)
I ↑think (EM) or TV shows at least the ones that I’ve been watching have been getting better [laughs] frankly. Maybe I don’t watch the bad ones. Of ↑course I don’t because I don’t like them right? Um ↑anyway there’s a lot of really good ones that I really like. Things like True Detective. I enjoyed Fargo recently: um these ones that are more on the HBO model. Those are my favorites.

Veg: (25.0)
I think (DM) being a vegetarian is probably (.4) a pretty noble thing but it’s something that (.4) I (.3) don’t do currently. (.5) Um (.) a lot of (.) my friends are vegetarians. Some of them are vegan (1.1) and I (.4) um (1.3) I ↑guess (EM) I try to be a little bit close to vegetarian but uh (.5) I still don’t- do eat meat a little bit less than some other people.

Charlotte: 1 (29.0)
Uh: she should (.) probably: email everyone and tell them (.) that she got the ↑date wrong (.5) but ↑also (.3) leave a note on her door on Friday night (.) cause what if people show up and no one’s there? That would be very sad. (1.6) So um (.6) uh her ↑friends might be very mad at her once they’ve already planned to come on Friday but then they were going to come on Saturday instead but (.6) um (.7) it’s: (1.1) ↑you know an honest mistake they’ll understand.

Charlotte 2: (20.6)
Um: I ↑guess (EM) another way would be (.) to (.) move the (.3) party to Friday. (.8) Um (1.1) that might actually be easier (.) cause (.8). Well it depends on how much planning she put into this the Saturday date and how many people uh know the Saturday date but (.) that would be ↑another way to solve the problem obviously just to just hold the party on Friday cause everyone thinks it’s Friday already.

Charlotte 3: (24.3)
My ↑impression? (.6) Um: ↑Charlotte (1.1) ↑I dunno I don’t have much of an impression I think it’s pretty honest mistake anyone could do that. (2.8) Dunno I guess (.3) she’s probably not the most meticulous person in the world (.) but (1.3) um (2.2) y’know (1.5) I ↑think (EM) she’s a fine understanding person.

Gary 1: (27.6)
I ↑think (EM) Gary should (.6) apologize to (.3) Jane (.9) and: buy a new alarm clock. (.7) Or set his phone to go off so he’s not late ↑again. (1.5) cause it’s ↑inconsiderate. (2.0) And um [laughs] uh: it’s probably not the worst thing in the world because it was just a breakfast meet but um (.7) [clears throat] (.4) um ↑it’s something he should probably try to avoid at least in the future.

Gary 2: (21.9)
Well computer I have already touched on this. Um (.) he ↑could get a new (1.0) um (.3) alarm clock (.8) ↑or he could go to bed ↑earlier or learn to use his cell phone as a (1.0) um (.3) alarm clock (.6) or he could not make (1.2) uh ↑appointments at times that he (.4) thinks he’s gonna sleep in (1.1) [laughs].

Gary 3: (31.9)
↑Well again I don’t think (EM) it’s (.) easy to form a full-fledged opinion from ↑this but (.6) ↑again also (.) um (.9) if (1.0) you: if this is a ↑regular pattern then (.7) Gary (.3) could be (.4) a little less considerate than other ↑people. Uh (1.3) if he knew he had an appointment he could’ve (.4) tried to take some steps to get there on time (.7) [clears throat] (1.4) but y’know Jane still seems to like him so (.5) I (.8) I don’t have anything ↑really bad to say about George.

Jimmy 1: (21.3)
Well ↑it’s (.) not really (.3) supported by the evidence (.6) cause he had only gone one direction. (1.0) Um (.8) so (.) you ↑know that (1.1) ↑ at least (1.9) it’s: you- you’ve ↑seen that (.4) sometimes when it’s raining it’s because there are clouds in the sky at least if you believe Dad.

Jimmy 2: (23.4)
Um through reasoned debate in the Socratic method (0.4) perhaps [laughs] (.3) like asking him (.7) um “have you ever seen clouds in the sky (.4) when it’s not ↑raining? (.9) So what would that tell you about your (.) conclusion?” (1.1) Um (.8) and it also talked a little bit about (.7) how um ↑even in the other direction it was a little bit off (.3) so.

Jimmy 3: (27.8)
Um my impression is that he’s probably ↑young because his name is (.9) Jimmy (.7) and he’s talking to his dad a lot about (.3) he doesn’t know why it ↑rains. (1.2) Um and therefore (1.1) I ↑don’t really have an impression as to his reasoning abilities because uh I think (DM) ↑everyone when they’re young has (.6) imperfect reasoning abilities (.9) so (1.1) think (DM) Jimmy’s a f- (1.5) fine young ↑man.


Group 1: Kat
ANIMAL: (32.4)
The bravest animal (1.5) oh my god (DIR) that’s a hard question. (.) Are animals brave? (.8) Becau- I don’t even know if they are ↑brave (.3 because (1.5) brave implies: that you’re you know (.4) getting your courage up. (.) And I don’t- I don’t know if the animals get their courage up. I ↑feel like (EM) they: (.7) are so: (.3) naturally: (.9) intuitively (.2) responding and moving and doing (.4) ↑maybe brave things all the time but I don’t ↑know (EM) if I’d call it brave.

LEADER: (38.4)
Well (.4) (DIR) that’s a good question too, because I’ve been thinking about that a lot. (2.4) Because (DIR) there’s a lot of leadership required here: and you know Roos Roast with John. (.7) So what makes someone a good leader is (.3) I- I ↑think (EM) decisiveness is really important (.) in a leader. (.5) But ↑I ↑also think (MC) emotional intelligence is also really important for a leader’s life work but you also don't have that. (1.0) Um (1.2) and ↑also a trust: I think (DM) a trust in the goodness like you know you’re gonna (1.3) you know trust that ↑somebody (1.2) is trying their best.

SCHOOL: (25.0)
I don’t know what are the subjects in school. (1.1) Like math? I mean I don’t even know what they do in school now. Math’s probably hard (2.0) physics. (2.0) I- I mean I ↑don’t ↑think (EM) there’s a hard ma- I even (.7) maybe analyze each question but I (.3) you know would it’s har- everyone has a different one so (DIR) it’s difficult to say which is the hardest.

SECOND LANG: (29.5)
(DIR) My opinion is that (.3) it is good to learn a second language. (.5) And um (.) you know I- I wanted ((chose)) I have a little five year old. I put him in like a Spanish immersion school (.) like right when he was- (.) cause I ↑feel like (EM) it’s (.7) so great to just like get that mind you know expanded, because (DIR) a second language is just so hard to do to learn. ↑I think (MC) for me it’s been really hard to learn like maybe doing it later. (1.1) But (DIR) it’s so: great.

SPACE: (24.2)
I ↑don’t know I have a lot of ideas about ↑space travel (.) in the ↑future. Um (1.2) I don’t know I don’t really ↑care about that so much. I mean I ↑think (EM) it’s cool but I: I’m more into like um (.9) inner (.7) space travel ((laughs)) the consciousness, you know exploring like (.5) conscious (.6) where consciousness can travel, so like non:-physical travel I’m more interested in.

STORY: (28.6)
I mean not knowing how it ends (.5) I guess (DM) (.4) um: (1.2) (DIR) there’s always some kind of twist or something (.2) um (.7) or some detail or something a story may also like show you something (.3) that you never thought (.5) um you would be like (.4) show you something that you know is true that you (.2) hadn’t thought of before: (.6) um or it’s maybe about someone (.5) that you’d like to be: or (.3) you know someone different from yourself.

SUMMER: (23.3)
Hm: a good place to travel in the summer ↑I really (.9) I ↑think (EM) it’s always great to go up north to some place up north in Michigan but (.) um: (1.1) cause (DIR) it’s beautiful up there and you wouldn’t wanna go in winter necessarily. Beautiful lakes, (DIR) swimming in the lake is really (.3) the best. (1.5) And: (.5) yeah (.) where else would you go in the summer?

TV: (22.8)
Current TV shows I ↑don’t really (.) we don’t have a TV you know but we do watch TV on Netflix so I don’t ↑feel like (EM) I’m really that in tune with current TV shows, except for this really sort of filtered way like (.) what’s: you know what’s Netflix have: ((laughs)) so or Amazon (.2) instant (.2) prime so that’s my experience with TV shows.

VEG: (32.6)
↑Well (.) God I know (DIR) that’s a big question. I was a vegetarian (.6) for a while: and I ↑still consider myself like a low meat eater (.5) but (.) I live with John Roos. (1.1) And every ↑time I’ll ↑just I- cause I don’t really know how to cook meat, so I’ll just be you know I mostly cook vegetarian, but then he’d always like bring home a big chunk of like (.4) you know pork shoulder or something, and all of a sudden we’re eating pork shoulder for the whole week. (.8) So: I- wha- so I ↑feel: (EM) (.8) ah I’m not (.3) I ↑feel like (EM) I’m not always living up to my own ↑ideal.


Group 2: William
ANIMAL:
The ↑bravest animal I would say: (DM) (.3) would be: (.7) the: (6.0) uh: (.5) the: I’ll just say the ↑hawk (.) because (.6) they are there’s not too many of them, and you know despite being a predatory species, they have to: (.8) they- they (DIR) it’s actually very difficult for them to hunt for food, and I think (DM) (.8) for example, in contrast being a grazing animal like a cow, they don't really do much. They just- there’s grass everywhere in front of them, but for something like a ↑hawk, they have to be- they have to venture out very f- (.6) very long distances in search of food and to support their young.

LEADER: (29.5)
(DIR) Confidence (.) and (.5) respect. (.7) A ↑good leader doesn’t necessarily mean they always make good ↑decisions. It’s- they’re a good leader because they inspire they have a lot of confidence which inspires respect so that people follow them. (.4) And obviously you know there is (.4) ↑some baseline level of good decision making skills, but (4) in my opinion I think (DM) (.2) the vast majority of what makes a ↑leader is definitely confidence.

SCHOOL: (31.9)
Uh: in my opinion the hardest school subject would ↑probably be something that is (2.5) memorization based in my opinion, just because (.8) uh: that’s (.7) something that I guess (DM) I was always weak ↑at (.) and just because there’s no (.) there’s no uh: (.9) there’s always (.2) (DIR) it’s ↑really easy to fall into a pattern. You know when you- when you memorize either words or subjects or topics, (DIR) it’s very easy to just follow- for your brain to always categorize them as the same subject, and when that happens everything just kinda gets mixed up.

SECOND LANG: (37.5)
↑I think (MC) (.5) ↑everyone should learn a second language or more if possible because I’m of the belief that (.5) being more ↑cultured in general which is a consequence of learning a second language (.4) is ↑very helpful towards a person’s (1.1) overall: intellectual well-being. (1.1) And uh: (.6) just (.4) that’s (.7) it (1.6) it (.4) and (1.5) furthermore, it just I think (DM) it (.) it (.2) allows better: globalization in the sense that people are more able to communicate with each other instead of being isolated in their own communities.

SPACE: (20.9)
I’m- ↑I’m personally very passionate about that topic because I think (DM) (.) it is a necessary: (.6) future for humanity. Whether people (.3) have like whatever opinions people have of it I think (DM) it is absolutely necessary, because (DIR) this planet is not in its ↑current form at the rate that the population is increasing and the rate that we’re using ↑energy (.3) (DIR) it is not sustainable for us to stay on this planet indefinitely (.4) as a human species.

STORY: (27.4)
A story is ↑interesting in my ↑opinion (.) when it’s not cliché: or (1.4) boring: I guess (DM) but (DIR) that’s not a very descriptive word. But so what I mean by cliché is (1.4) if it’s easy predictable you know. You’ve seen the story before or some variation of it. If it’s (.4) ↑not cliché if it’s very unique it inspires deep thought (.4) and uh (1.2) inspiration: then (.3) uh so on and so forth.

SUMMER: (22.6)
My favorite place to travel during the summer would be somewhere very (.4) but outdoor- that has a very good outdoor destination, for example (.) a: few years ago I went up to Canada to this place called BAMF national park and ↑I thought (MC) it was just the most gorgeous place in the world. (.4) And I loved ↑hiking through it and (.4) absorbing the- the sites, you know getting away from people and just (.3) enjoying nature in general.

TV: (26.6)
↑I think (MC) they’re a total waste of time (.7) because I am not engaged in any TV show and I kinda see them as just kind of (.3) like mindless (.3) blabber (.3) for the masses. ((Laughs)) I mean right now you have like mostly like reality TV shows or (.5) comedies. ↑Comedies could be interesting you know cause if they’re you know they make me laugh, but reality TV shows I just do not see the: (.9) uh I don’t see why they’re interesting at all.

VEG: (27.2)
I am ↑not a vegetarian. (.9) But if I ↑were (.2) I: (1.4) my opinion would be (.8) that (1.8) I’m doing it for (.5) health benefits, and (.8) ethical benefits (.6) as in (1.2) in ↑general eating vegetables and fruit is considered ↑healthy if you I mean if you’re not exercising all the time. If you just get the necessary calories the nutrients that’s enough.

CHARLOTTE 1: (20.1)
She: should (.5) ↑contact all of her friends (.5) and tell them that (.) the date was a ↑mistake and that the party is actually on Saturday (.5) and she should probably do it in the most (.3) ↑timely way possibly preferably by (.6) ↑texting or phone call so that they get a message (.2) as soon as possible.

CHARLOTTE 2: (22.4)
↑Another way (.2) for her to solve this ↑problem I suppose (DM) would be to: (1.9) for example if this was a party involving a lot of ↑people and (.3) the set up (.5) isn’t too (.6) extravagant she should probably just change it to (.6) ↑Friday then (.9) as to not inconvenience (.2) that many (.4) people.

CHARLOTTE 3: (26.3)
Uh she: is not (.) a very organized ↑person. Although everyone makes mistakes (.7) setting up an event like that you have to maybe make sure (.2) to be (.) as (.5) careful as possible because (.) I mean you’re involving other people (.4) in this and (.3) they’ve already (.4) they have schedules and time commitments (.7) and uh (.6) for ↑any kind of social large social event you should be as prepared as possible.

GARY 1: (37.9)
He should (.5) ↑apologize to Jane (.3) in personal preferably and not over the phone or text message because that seems (.7) it’s a bit of a more of a ↑personal touch (.) and (.8) to just say that “I’m deeply ↑sorry (.) that I missed the ↑breakfast (.2) I mean that I overslept (.4) and I will make it up to you (.3) somehow” (3.1) and (1.1) uh (2.2) again he should uh he should be very (.3) ↑curt and ↑short in his apology because no one wants to hear a long-winded (.5) apology.

GARY 2: (30.1)
(DIR) By: (1.1) being a more disciplined person (.) because (1.6) although again everyone makes mistakes but (.9) only with discipline you make less of them (.2) for example (.4) making sure he sets his alarm clock and not going to bed too late when you have to wake up really early the next morning for breakfast (1.6) and (1.9) uh (.9) just being a: more organized person.

GARY 3: (34.0)
Uh (.7) (DIR) my ↑impression of him is that (1.8) uh he is (1.2) someone who well based on just (.) this one fact about him and yeah again you should never (.2) make (.)↑conclusions about any person b- just based on one mistake (.3) but if I ↑had to (.) I would ↑say that (EM) (.8) he is a (.2) very sloppy and lazy person who sleeps in (.9) and does not take his commitments seriously (1.4) and in the ↑future he should (.7) again be more disciplined.

JIMMY 1: (30.6)
I think (DM) it is a valid ↑conclusion based on what his dad told him. (.) His dad specifically said if (.2) it only rains when there are ↑clouds in the sky well naturally to a kid (.5) who isn’t (1.1) completely ↑educated on the subject will naturally take that (.7) you know as uh (.4) his dogma (2.0) and uh (.9) uh (.5) ((scoffs)) (4.2) Jimmy could perhaps (.6) be more ↑inquisitive and ask his dad.

JIMMY 2: (29.7)
By (.4) being (.3) by ↑elaborating a little more on example when it rains. For example just saying when there are ↑clouds (.7) it is only one criteria for there to be rain. He could perhaps (.2) say (1.1) “Now there are ↑several conditions required for there to be rain. (.5) Clouds is just one of them. ↑Other (.) could be (.2) for example how (.5) ↑humid it is outside or (.4) how ↑thick the clouds are or: (.6) the temperature and variety of other- other factors.”

JIMMY 3: (37.6)
(DIR) He: is a ↑normal ↑kid and is very curious (.) and I think (DM) that is very (.5) for ↑any kid being curious and asking questions is a very good trait to have in a kid because it just shows that they’re ↑curious and (DIR) curiosity is a- is a (.4) good (.9) trait to have (.) in a person (.6.4) and (.2) Jimmy (1.4) ((scoffs)) (4.3) Jimmy: uh: can ((laughs)) uh:.


Group 2: Betsy
ANIMAL: (20.5)
I ↑think (EM) all animals are brave (1.6) because (4.5) they’re ↑all- they ↑can- yeah ani- ↑all animals are brave just cause they have their own (1.0) aggressive nature to survive (1.2) so um.

LEADER: (24.9)
I ↑guess a good leader is really dominant expressive I don’t know. Like if he seems really ↑honest (1.1) I guess (DM) (1.2) because (DIR) those traits are important cause I guess (DM) they’ll lets people put their trust in you so: that’s how you’re able to lead people.

SCHOOL: (22.8)
Uh it’s always been English cause it’s- it was a ↑second language. Well now it’s my first language but no one really ever taught me: formal English. It was something I just learned on my own (1.0) and I didn’t really understand grammar until SAT in high school which is kind of depressing to admit.

SECOND LANG: (24.6)
I think (DM) ↑learning a second language is really important because (1.0) it (1.0) brings in ↑knowledge about learning about other ↑cultures and stuff and (DIR) it’s really good skill to have (1.2) do work not just any I don’t know (2.3) um I just have to keep talking right?

SPACE: (25.3)
Space traveling is: (1.2) never really ↑thought that much about space traveling but I ↑think (EM) it’s something that people should definitely look into  cause (1.7) the world itself is more than just ↑earth. I don’t know it just ↑interesting to know what’s out there than just (2.0) humans like on like planet.

STORY: (28.1)
(DIR) An ↑interesting story is something that’s never: like an idea that hasn’t been written. (DIR) Um: (1.6) interesting plot line (1.3) with unusual characters fascinating. Well ↑everyone has different tastes so it’s whatever sparks your interest so (1.7) yeah. Don’t really have a really strong opinion about that.

SUMMER: (26.3)
I don’t have an opinion on this. (DIR) It’s just wherever you wanna go. Wherever you wanna go in the summer then that’s a good place to travel. (1.7) Okay um: (3.3) like ↑just exploring so wherever you have a good time: (DIR) it’s a good place to go during the summer. (1.0) Um: (3.3) like for ↑me: I’d wanna go to Japan.

TV: (19.9)
Um: I ↑think (EM) television s pretty bad. I ↑think (EM) it’s overly exaggerated kind of boring. (DIR) It’s really redundant (2.1) and I ↑feel like (EM) it’s just like an American thing so can’t get used to it. (2.0) Um:.

VEG: (21.9)
If it’s religious it’s fine (1.4) but if you’re doin’ it to be a part of like (1.7) I don’t know I don’t understand why diets ↑trend but I feel like (DM) being vegetarian or vegan right now is trending and it makes people feel ↑healther. If ↑it’s for ↑that reason then you’re kind of stupid.

CHARLOTTE 1: (20.4)
(DIR) Call all her friends and be like “Yes it’s actually on ↑Saturday and I messed up”. (1.2) So: and if it doesn’t work for people then just reschedule it (1.0) but ((then again)) know I don’t think that’s a really big deal either so don’t really have (2.3) Oh god ((laughs)) no- no okay no.

CHARLOTTE 2: (20.9)
↑Other than to make a facebook event and tell her friends or like call them or send another invitation (2.5) make ↑another event? (1.5) For another time if none of those options work (1.1) so everyone can ↑go? I don’t know I ↑feel like (EM) I already said all the other options.

CHARLOTTE 3: (19.8)
She ↑seems kind of: clumsy. (1.2) Like if ↑I were to do an invitation I would proofread everything just to double check. (1.1) Um: but (DIR) that’s okay. (1.2) It was a mistake. (1.1) She might have gotten the dates mixed up or something.

GARY 1: (25.9)
Gary should just apologize and replan the date I guess (DM). Wait is that what the story was? Okay yeah just ↑making sure. (1.1) (DIR) Just say “Sorry (1.4) slept in again ((watch ya)) later” (1.1) Then: (2.6) I mean it’s a ↑pretty reasonable: excuse.

GARY 2: (21.2)
I mean ↑assuming that like he feels bad about it it probably won’t happen again (1.0) cause Gary’s probably a good guy and learned his lesson (1.2) so (1.8) probably won’t happen but if it ↑does happen I don’t know set like five alarms (1.2) continuous alarms.

GARY 3: (20.6)
I don’t ↑have an impression because this is just a made up scenario but he just seems like a normal kid that just kind of messed ↑up. (1.0) Just an accident not a big deal (1.1) slept in. (DIR) It’s normal. We all wanna sleep in. (1.1) Yep um (1.3) it’s just a movie.

JIMMY 1: (22.9)
Okay well the first thing I thought of was just (1.5) the thing I learned from psych (1.2) ((laughs)) in winter ↑quarter where this like conditioning yourself. It’s just a dog ri- like when a bell rings they just think that they get a ↑treat and in Jimmy’s case it’s like cloudy thinks it’s gonna rain.

JIMMY 2: (21.7)
Nature doesn’t work that ↑way? Just cause it’s cloudy doesn’t mean that it rains. (1.7) Um probably take him out on a day when it’s cloudy and not ↑raining. Just (1.3) recondition his thinking? And um (2.3) show him some scenes in animal planet ((laughs)).

JIMMY 3: (32.3)
He could be four years old really young doesn’t understand anything and he reminds me of the kids that come into my work. It’s kind of frustrating (2.4) like (1.0) um (3.7) just hard to deal with and kinda (1.3) clueless. I mean ↑all kids are.


Group 2: Hong
CHARLOTTE 1: (25.4)
Oh only thing can make up directly call the person who she ↑invited then (DIR) tell them she got the wrong date. (DIR) Correct ↑date um to see if ↑still can catch the time. If the ↑more person uh involved he c- she can- Charlotte can send ↑email or ↑text message. That may be faster.

CHARLOTTE 2: (28.5)
I- ↑Charlotte kind of easy. Just call her friends said “Hey I made a mistake. I got the wrong date. Can you ↑please come on Saturday instead of Friday?” I ↑think (EM) uh Charlotte’s friends will don’t mind about that and Sharon maybe next time just make a notes: to- to be careful a little bit should be fine. It’s no big deal just wrong date time.

CHARLOTTE 3: (32.0)
Charlotte’s girl looks like not very very careful about some details the small things but uh it- it’s not a very big huge deal. Uh Charlotte is uh kind of like ↑maybe she’s hurry doing some multi task at the same time. She just missed the date then really hurry to send something out uh but uh Charlotte maybe can ↑slow down a little bit but ↑that is I think (DM) just- ((just- just- just)).

GARY 1: (23.8)
Uh ↑Gary I think (DM) if I was the Gary I’d make the ↑alarm cause he told me the breakfast eight. I don’t want to sleep ↑past the hour to miss the ↑breakfast so the easier thing make ↑alarm on the ↑phone or on the ↑clock so I won’t miss the- the time. I can go to the breakfast ↑before eight.

GARY 2: (24.4)
The ↑future: I think (DM) first thing remember: the- the time. Uh he can do put some notes on the calendar uh or he can do uh when he receive the message directly go to the alarm to ↑set alarm. Uh then the next morning he won’t ↑miss that because sometimes we do something: maybe we just ↑forget about that.

GARY 3: (22.2)
↑Gary is who missed the uh time? Uh I ↑think (EM) Gary’s kind of like not very detailed ↑person. Uh seems like (EM) he just mm not very detail-oriented organized:. Maybe he need to be more ↑organized about his stuff so he won’t ↑forget something.

JIMMY 1: (21.7)
I don’t ↑think this is definitely the best answer about Jimmy’s conclusion because there is different situation if you see the clouds on the sky. Number one it ↑could be rain if clouds the- the more the- the accumulate big enough they make the rain but sometimes you have clouds it ↑won’t rain just.

JIMMY 2: (22.8)
↑Jimmy’s father can uh say some kind of different condition to ↑Jimmy to told him [recording error] there’s not only one answer conclusion come from the clouds in the sky. For example the clouds in the sunshine go away you still feel ↑cool but it’s not ↑rain. Sometimes there ↑could be rain.

JIMMY 3: (17.4)
Uh (DIR) ↑Jimmy is a ↑kids. I think (DM) it’s not surprise because ↑sometimes kids only see one uh the: the situation. Then they just thinking one conclusion. (DIR) It’s ↑normal. Jimmy just a- a little kids but he can ↑learn something.


Group 3: Menmen
ANIMAL: (30.7)
Uh maybe the ↑bravest animal is a (1.1) um: it’s a ↑tiger or a ↑lion. I’m not so sure about it but I think (MC) the most bravest animal should be the ↑wild ones because you are never trained in the ↑zoo and they maybe they would uh adjust to the wild ↑life very ↑naturally and: maybe they would prey for their: uh pray for the uh other animals for food.

LEADER: (29.5)
I ↑think (EM) a good leader should be uh more or less ambitious. He would uh know uh what he wants to do and uh and what’s more he w- he- he should know that what he ↑how can he do it so it’s: uh usually a: a successful leader is a smart guy and uh: he can attra- uh he can attracts maybe people to focus on him.

SCHOOL: (25.3)
For ↑me the hardest school subject is chemistry because I can- it is too hard for me but just from the personal point of ↑view because I just think this is too ↑hard. Uh I don’t know how to say it but the chemistry is uh is- is- is- is- is ↑more uh ↑complicated and challenging for me than other subjects.

SECOND LANG: (24.8)
Uh for me learning a ↑second language is a very: uh basical thing for uh and (DIR) it’s necessary for society because uh: you know that eh: nowadays in ↑china or in the world English is very important and eh: uh a ↑second language can help different areas and countries to uh communicate ↑directly with each other.

SPACE: (24.6)
I think (DM) space ↑travel in the future will be more and more ↑prevalent uh than nowadays because of the: uh science and technologi- scientific and technological development and uh: I heard that uh eh: nowadays people can uh send the ashes of the dead people to the: um s- outer space.

STORY: (32.4)
Uh a very ↑interesting story: I think: (DM) uh it would present some tensions and it needs a very uh ↑interesting and exciting ↑plot to attract people to uh have the ↑intention or have the curiosity to uh keep on reading the ↑story and until the fin- f- uh until the ↑final part of it. (1.4) Um: uh to ↑me the most ↑interesting story may be the mysteries.

SUMMER: (31.9)
Uh I think (DM) the best place uh for traveling summer is uh uh the- the beach because we can see the ↑sea and the- the: the- the ↑sand and the maybe coconut ↑tree. 	It’s just very uh ↑hawaii thing yes I think (DM) and (1.7) yeah and: but ↑I uh have never been to a very uh ↑fancy beach but I uh: look ↑forward to going ↑there because I like swimming.

TV: (33.1) (2xDMF think)
Uh I think (DM) ↑current TV shows uh they uh in order to try to attract more and more ↑audience they would present some uh improper elements such as uh ↑violent and ↑sexual or very ↑dangerous things into it to attract uh people to watch this fil- uh watch this TV shows but I think (DM) it is not very good for the ↑development of the society especially for: the: the- the- the- the development of the children and:.

VEG: (35.4)
Hm I think (DM) um: it would be more ↑healthy to- it’s a more healthy way to eat food if you are a ↑vegetarian but um it depends be- maybe because in China if you are ↑Buddhist then you are a vegetarian so there are uh many people have the prejudices toward the uh vegetarian people because they think they would uh: be uh: they would be a ↑religious one or something like that but uh I’d ↑like to- I really want to try this kind of uh uh kind of way of eating ↑food.

CHARLOTTE 1: (26.7)
Mm: I think (DM) Charlotte should uh um: if ↑he has send the invitations ↑already uh he should uh uh ↑inform all the guests and friends to correct the s- the date and time of the uh ↑party to avoid their uh avoid inconveniences yeah and uh if ↑he did not send invitation he can correct it as soon as possible.

X CHARLOTTE 2: (9.5)

CHARLOTTE 3: (23.9)
Uh I think (DM) ↑Charlotte is more or less careless about the ↑arrangements. Maybe he is a very: uh is not a very ↑careful guy and uh um yeah (DIR) it’s fortun- ↑fortunately that uh she has found it uh before this party so (DIR) there’s a: chance an opportunity for her to correct it.

GARY 1: (27.7)
Uh I think (DM) ↑Gary should firstly apologize to Jane and (DIR) explain that why she- he would do that uh to uh:. Then Jane can forgive Gary for that and: I ↑think (EM) maybe uh ↑next time Gary should invite Jane ↑again to uh: dinner or uh yeah to some uh restaurants and.

GARY 2: (18.4)
He should uh remember this experience and (DIR) try to avoid such circumstance uh next time and uh I ↑think (EM) Jane can tell Gary what he could ↑do and ((the- the- the-)) to speak.

GARY 3: (20.8)
↑I think (MC) it’s understandable that if you sleep o- uh sleep too- too late because maybe the last night Gary do a lot of homeworks and something like that but uh: it depends on the his behavior in the next time and uh it depends on her uh his ↑action toward this kind of circumstances.

JIMMY 1: (30.5)
Mm: I think (DM) ↑Jimmy is generalize or is generalizing all the ↑circumstances and uh ↑but uh if ↑Jimmy is a ↑child or a teenager (DIR) it is understandable because of his dad’s uh did not uh didn’t do very well to uh teach him that how it did ↑rain or explain the theory of the uh weather condition.

JIMMY 2: (34.9)
He can explain it to Jimmy ↑again and tell her- told him that “uh maybe uh not every time it is cloudy that it will ↑rain”. Uh it’s cloudy just because it’s cloudy because it’s not sunny yeah (1.0) and: he can try to explain that ↑why it will rain correctly and (DIR) told him that “every time you meet this situation you should: not to uh you should not generalize all the uh conditions”.

JIMMY 3: (32.6)
Uh what does the impression of Jimmy? I think (DM) Jimmy is um: (3.0) I don’t know it depends on Jimmy’s ↑age. If he’s an adult ↑I think (MC) he’s too uh: too quick to make a decision or make a connection between uh (1.0) two things or two conditions and uh (DIR) there is something to correct about Jimmy’s opinions or his beha- uh his habits of thinking about things and relate things.


Group 3: Yujiyang
ANIMAL: (18.2)
I think (DM) it might be a ↑tiger (1.0) because- because a ↑mountain can’t- can’t live two tiger- two tigers and (DIR) a tiger is very very (1.0) uh ↑huge I think (DM) so I think (DM) it’s ↑tiger is the bravest- ↑bravest animals in the ↑nature.

LEADER: (25.3)
↑I think (MC) great- great communicate uh with ↑others make a good leader because if- if you- if ↑you want to be a good lead- ↑good leader you- you must ha- have a very very good and deep ↑relationships with each other and you can- you can build ↑team and do something: something one- one person can’t- can’t do it.

SCHOOL: (32.0)
↑I think: (MC) I think (DM) for ↑me it’s English because every subject in my- in ↑now it’s teached by English and I- I must to learn ↑many many English so I think (DM) ↑English is very difficult for me now. (2.8) Um (1.6) uh ↑calc- calculus you know I think (DM) calculus is difficult but teach calculus by English is ↑much difficult.

SECOND LANG: (30.9)
I think (DM) learning a second language (1.0) is ↑quite difficult- is quite difficult but I shall try my ↑best to learn- ↑learn it (1.1) like: ↑I think (MC) I like- I like German very much but I think (DM) it’s ↑too difficult to me. (1.1) It’s very very uh uh (1.7) I have- I have ↑tried to learn it before but I failed. Uh I can speak some- some ↑Japanese.

SPACE: (24.9)
((rule of)) verne (1.3) I think (DM) it’s a- it’s a- it’s a: he write a ↑novel and I read it times by times many many times uh and I think (DM) space traveling will be ↑popular in the future and ↑everyone can go the s- go to space and see the planets sun or-↑or in- into the ↑sun. I think (DM) it’s ↑cool.

X STORY: () ()

SUMMER: (27.7)
↑I think (MC) it’s- it’s a ↑small- small town named ((Xi Tang)). It’s- it’s next to the- it’s next to the Shanghai. Uh a river through this town and it’s very very old has a ((one thousand year)) ↑more than- more than one thousand year history so I have been there this summer- summer vacation summer holiday so I think (DM) ((↑Xi Tang)) is a very good place to travel in summer.


TV: (21.5)
I think (DM) it- it make- it can make me: it can make me life ↑interesting and ↑colorful. It’s (1.7) it’s: (1.0) it’s kind of my life. (1.1) I watch it with my family and we chat and it can improve our- our ↑relationships.

VEG: (24.6)
↑I think (MC) it’s called- ah I can’t do this. I’m a- I’m a meat eater. Uh ↑only eat vegetables can leave some: ↑illness and things but- but it’s depend on their ↑belief or some- someone ((↑can’t  ??)) some belief.

CHARLOTTE 1: (26.1)
Uh she: I think (DM) she have to prepare for the party what- whenever it will be held and (1.7) and (DIR) just do what he can do and (DIR) just wait. (2.1) Uh (1.9) do if- if you can- can I- can I hear listen to the story again?

CHARLOTTE 2: (32.1)
↑I think (MC) he (1.2) if he: if she- if she want to hold a big ↑party I think (DM) he should send ↑invitation to his friend and his (1.0) his classmates and (DIR) change the- change another place to held this party and (2.3) um: (2.0) and (DIR) prepare for- for other things (1.0) he could do and (DIR) just have fun.

CHARLOTTE 3: (32.1)
↑I think (MC) he is: (1.6) he is a not- not very smart girl and: he should ↑guess- he should seen this problem and: (DIR) try to solve- solve the problem and: and he can- he can: (2.1) can- he can: he can try something to: to hold the- hold the party: ↑when he- when he wan- when he want and I ↑think (EM) so.

GARY 1: (23.0)
(DIR) Eat breakfast ((qui-)) quickly as he can and (DIR) go to school. (DIR) Do something. (DIR) Do something he- he should do and: eh he- he’s late- he’s late for something for something (1.6) and: (DIR) his- his friend is very offended.

GARY 2: (25.9)
↑He should set a (2.6) ↑he should ask his- his friend to get up ↑early and (DIR) ask h- ask him to get up early too and: (1.2) maybe his fa- his ↑mother and his father can call him if he doesn’t- he doesn’t can get up himself and: (1.5) if he may have a phone.

GARY 3: (16.8)
Ha I think (DM) he’s so- he’s so stupid and uh: he’s someone- someone will wait for him and someone will some- someone will maybe ↑angry or- or maybe may have a bad impression on him so ↑I think (MC) it’s very very stupid.

JIMMY 1: (22.1)
I think (DM) he’s ↑right. ↑I think (MC) ↑clouds with- with the- with the rain if ↑many clouds of- of the in the ↑sky I think (DM) it will it refers to rain. No no it- it not refers. It will- it will lead to rain.

JIMMY 2: (21.3)
Uh ↑I think: (MC) his father can show him when the- when cloud in the sky it ↑then it not rain. I think (DM) his father can ↑show him. Can show- one day his father can show him all this.

JIMMY 3: (30.1)
(DIR) It’s very ↑cute. (DIR) He- he is very cute and: and ↑I think (MC) he’s a ↑little boy and: study- study on grade- gra- grade one or ((else)) two. He didn’t- didn’t learn some uh some about the climate or something. (3.6) Um (1.9) ((laughs)) um (1.6) he is- uh ↑I think (MC) he is cute.


Group 3: Yanan
ANIMAL: (52.4) (2xDME think)
Maybe- maybe the ↑dog is the bravest animal I think (DM). Mm: you know dog- dog um: have been uh (1.0) mm dog- ↑dogs help uh rescued many peoples in the uh ↑fire. Uh mm uh it will uh it uh it means that dogs will not it- it’s um ↑not fear the uh mm ((latent)) uh (1.4) risks and- and it will mm (1.3) mm do something uh help to him its (4.0) uh its uh like its families I think (DM).

LEADER: (41.9) (1xEM think)
I ↑think that (EM) a- a good leader must uh know ↑all the works of uh his or her uh mm mm: ↑participants. Uh mm ↑and he or she um should help them maybe have some ↑troubles in work or um ↑and be mm tolerant- ↑tolerant or uh and mm mm ↑he um he should um: shoul- ↑shouldn’t blame on them too much.

SCHOOL: (47.0) (1xEM think, 1xDMF think)
I- I ↑never uh touched the subject like art. Uh (1.1) uh so I first uh I should uh investigate some mm the (1.2) uh (1.4) ↑knowledge about this subject and then I will mm ask some- somebody like my classmates or others to help me. Uh I ↑think (EM) it’s a- a great- a- a great and a great job mm: and it- it’s beyo- ↑beyond my uh ability so I think (DM) it's a: it’s ha- it’s hard to me and ↑but- but I will- I will try and uh ↑challenge it and try my best to do it.

SECOND LANG: (33.7) (1xDMF think)
Um I think (DM) it’s a good- it’s a very good mm um (1.1) it’s a very good idea and uh um (1.2) mm very like to do it to learn second language like this English even though my English is just so-so and I- I hope I can learn- I can speak English much fluent in the future and I can um mm uh keep in touch with something like in: uh uh keep in touch with someone like uh in- in a foreign country,

SPACE: (50.7) (1xEM think, 1xDMF think)
Um I ↑think (EM) uh and- and- and in the morning I- I see the uh mm the fin- the findings of (1.0) um uh ↑water or something like water in- in uh: uh in another planet uh but not Earth. Uh I think (DM) it’s- mm it’s- it’s ↑possible that we- we can go there uh in the future in some- something like spa- uh space flight or something like uh the (1.0) mm the ↑train or some- or- or even uh even a bus and we can- we can still some mm like trans- transportation or.

STORY: (63.4) (1xDMF think)
Mm I think (DM) that uh it’s the it’s- it’s- it’s mm (1.0) uh the people who mm tell- told uh tells the story is very important and he or she use something uh interesting whereas um uh uh interesting tolds that we can maybe or we will be uh ↑attracted by he or uh by him or her and uh the next or is the ↑content of the story and uh maybe and it should mm be (1.3) uh: (1.5) um it should be (1.0) um: (3.1) mm uh I- I mean that uh ↑different people like uh ↑children or teenager or uh adult you should uh hear uh listen to different stories.

SUMMER: (42.2) (1xDMF think)
The is some place like the mm: ↑tibet or um maybe not the ↑exact name but you know. Uh I- I think (DM) uh the firstly weather is very okay to uh ↑there in the summer because in the clouds are all white and the ↑sky is ↑blue uh and uh we can see many uh mm residents there and many uh and we um we- we- we can know their ↑cultures

TV: (37.8) (1xEM don’t think)
Uh um actually I don’t like the (1.2) um ↑idiot. I- I don’t know- no mm I mean the TV shows that just many mm handsome- handsome ↑boys and beautiful girls I don’t like them and I don’t- I don’t ↑think (EM) that they act very well. Uh I and ↑now the mm: the movies like mm uh ↑more focusing on actions on the- the ↑future mm uh ↑knowledges I- uh I ↑prefer to.

VEG: (31.4) (1xDMF think)
Actually (1.8) I like eating meat very much [laughs] so uh I can (1.6) uh (1.1) um ↑can’t understand them very much so but- but I- I respect them. I think (DM) it’s a just opinion being uh in our life and mm maybe some mm some days maybe ↑in some days I will be a vegetarian [laughs].
