Group 1: Kath
Animal: (35.7)
The ↑bravest animal um:  that’s actually a pretty hard ↑question. Um: I guess the bravest animal would probably be: (1.3) something that lives in the ↑ocean because the ocean is a very scary place um: (1.0) especially because there are a lot of things that live deep in the ↑water that will kill you [laughs] um so I guess being like a fish or a dolphin would be very ↑brave because you don’t know what’s below you and it could just come up and eat you.

Leader: (32.6)
Um a good leader is ↑empathetic and understands um what’s important and how to make that happen. Um they think more about an end goal rather than thinking about themselves exclusively. Um: (0.9) and a good leader is also usually very ↑organized and good at planning and good at keeping track of what other people ↑need.

School: (29.4)
Um the hardest school subject: I guess the hardest school subject is history because you just have to memorize a bunch of things and you can’t think about it logically um so you just kind of have to remember things even if they’re ↑boring um and you also have to memorize a lot of pointless things like dates so um it’s hard to pay attention um care very much about the majority of ↑it.

Second Lang: (26.1)
Um I think learning a second language is: good for your ↑brain because it helps you establish different thought ↑patterns and um it’s also good for you physiologically because you learn how to make different sounds with your vocal cords and your mouth and um it can also help you think in new ways because there are cultural differences between languages.

Space: (30.9)
Space ↑travel is: uh a pretty cool thing to think about (0.9) um I don’t [laughs] know how realistic it ↑is but I think it would be pretty cool to take a spaceship and fly through space and see ↑nebulas and see other planets but I think that landing on another planet would be pretty scary because you might not be able to breathe the air and there could be aliens there that would want to eat you [laughs].

Story: (26.3)
Um stories are interesting if they have ↑mystery and um they build up for a long time and then they: (0.9) uh have some ↑suspense [laughs] and then they reach um a climax and you find out the suspenseful thing you’ve been waiting for and you (1.2) have fun listening [laughs] to it.

Summer: (24.0)
In the ↑summer it’s good to go up ↑north because if you go south it’s too hot um and too sunny so going north is good because you can get the perfect temperature and good ↑weather and: if you go north you also will get to a lake and [laughs] you can go swimming in it and that’s nice and cool so you have a good mixture of hot air and cool water.

TV: (32.1)
Um I think most current TV shows are pretty ↑boring (0.9) especially reality shows because they’re usually capitalizing off of people who um are like experiencing a negative situation um: (0.9) and: most mainstream TV is not very well written and relies a lot on boring humor and laugh ↑tracks and [laughs] there’re too many ↑commercials.

Veg: (18.9)
Being a vegetarian is a good ↑thing because eating animals is ↑bad [laughs]. They don’t taste very ↑good and it’s also sad to kill them because they: (1.1) have feelings and it’s not nice to k- cap- keep them captive and then murder them and steal their meat.

Charlotte 1: (30.9)
Um I guess Charlotte is gonna need to re-plan her party so she can have it on Friday. Um either that or she could call everyone she ↑invited and tell them that she made a mistake on the invitations (1.1). Um or: she could send out invitations with the right date. Um: (1.7) but: either way that really sucks and hopefully [laughs] she learns her lesson and double-checks all her invitations in the future.

Charlotte 2: (23.1)
She could uh she should call up all of her friends and family that she invited to the party and tell them to come on Saturday or she could send out new invitations for ↑everybody (1.0). Or: she: could potentially um: post about it on Facebook um.

Charlotte 3: (33.6)
Um it sounds like Charlotte is probably very ↑busy or maybe is um a little distracted or maybe is stressed out by something else um and maybe has too much going on if she doesn’t have time to read her invitations before she mails them. Um: I feel pretty bad for her that she addressed them and sent them all out the wrong date (1.2) but I understand how busy you can be and sometimes you don’t have time to double-check things.

Gary 1: (33.9)
Um ↑Gary sounds like (0.9) kind of a jerk. Um he wait I can’t remember which person it was that slept in. It was Gary? Okay yeah so ↑Gary should probably call his friend and apologize and: (1.2) either find out if Jake is: available to have breakfast on a different ↑day or find out if he can still go to breakfast and if he doesn’t have enough ↑time then Gary should feel bad.

Gary 2: (24.6)
Well Gary could set an ↑alarm or he could set a few alarms that’s usually what Trevor does to make up on time he ((usually)) sets like ten alarms to go off in like ten minutes so like an alarm goes off every minute. And then it’s really horrible for ↑me but it’s good for ↑him [laughs] because he wakes up on time um: so Gary should try maybe doing that [laughs].

Gary 3: (27.6)
Um I ↑feel like Gary probably either forgot that he had um a breakfast plan or else he maybe drank too much the night before and was hungover and overslept. Um either that or he probably got distracted doing something and stayed up too late. Um but either way my impression is that he probably doesn’t care very much about his friend.

Jimmy 1: (25.8)
Uh Jimmy sounds like he’s probably pretty ↑young either that or has pretty um concrete thinking and should probably start being taught to think more ↑abstractly. Um he sound- sounds like he’s probably a very little kid who’s um still thinking in black and white and cause and effect.

Jimmy 2: (28.8)
Jimmy’s father could: come up with a better reason why it’s raining like explain that the clouds are very full of water and [laughs] very heavy um so that the condensation causes the rain to ↑fall. Um or he could explain more about the ↑water cycle (1.0). Um I’m kind of surprised that Jimmy has never seen um a cloudy day before when it wasn’t raining.

Jimmy 3: (25.8)
My impression of Jimmy is uh that he’s not very ↑observant um: (1.0) he probably only noticed it was raining because he probably got wet from the rain or something. Um: (1.7) he- he ↑sounds like a curious person though which is good and hopefully he keeps asking questions [laughs] like that and wondering more about how the world works.


Group 1: Ezra
Animal: (29.7)
Ooh I’m not ↑sure if (0.7) bravery really is a concept that applies to animals. (.9 [breath]) Um [laughs].  (.6) Because: bravery (.7) involves knowing the consequences of your actions and if an animal doesn’t ↑really know (.7) conseque- I guess you could say that maybe (.) an animal like a (.) bee (.5) that is willing to give uh its life for the life of the hive (1) that’s (.5) if you impose (.5) human psychology on the bee than that would be brave.

Leader: (37.0)
These are tough questions. (.3) Uh [clears throat] (.6) I ↑think that a good leader is able to: um see (.) a lot of different aspects of a project and (.4) know when thinks (.) the ↑resources are not being allocated correctly towards those (.5) something I’m not very good at [laughs]. But I’ve learned since I (.6) had to start (.7) directing projects like that annotation project for ↑instance uh (.6) is and ↑also be able to motivate people so being able to get people on board with your (.9) vision of it.

School: (31.6)
Uh I ↑think that could be very different for different people so (.7) um (.9) a lot of people complain obviously about math (1.0) uh but I ↑think they (.4) maybe they’re: (1.1) giving themselves short shrift because I think that people probably can do math a lot better (.4) than they ↑think they can. Other people are much worse at (.8) other subjects.

Second Lang: (27.2)
Um: my opinion on it. That makes it sound like it’s sort of a moral thing. (.7) Um (.8) I ↑think that learning another language is very important for people’s development. Um (.6) that’s why they do it in-in (.) in school. And it’s also important for: learning about other cultures I think (.5). Um (.) but it’s also just introduces you to a new (.3) way of (.)↑thinking a new way of speaking and you could maybe learn something about your own language too.

Space: (30.7)
Oh (.3) I’m (.) uh very excited for space travel in the future. (.8) Um (.7) I dunno it would be exciting to see if they ever get a project together to go to Mars in our lifetime. I think that would be really cool. (.4) I’m ↑assuming you mean space travel by humans. (.3) What would be ↑really exciting in the (.) far future would be if we could go (.9) much faster like faster than ↑light or um (.) things like that explore other parts of the universe cause there’s so much out there (.3) that’s not (.5) in our neighborhood.

Story: (31.4)
Um (.) I ↑think a story is interesting when it has some tension in it. (.7) So there’s some sort of co-↑conflict that (.) who come from any (.) source that needs to be worked through. (.6) Um usually (.3) good stories have a beginning and a middle and an end. (.8) Uh unlike this ↑answer. (.6) [laughs] So uh (1.0) the story also will have (.4) uh (.7) uh (.3) some excitement. Some uh fun use of language. Some (.5) imagery.

Summer: (21.1)
Oh (1.3) this is (.4) I ↑think uh (.) again there’s a lot of good places to travel in the summer. (.) Tuscany, for instance. (.6) Um (.) I (.) definitely like going to ↑Europe. (.3) cause they have lots of (.5) old and (.) beautiful things to look at and the culture’s really cool. (.3) They have good food. (.5) But ↑you could also just go somewhere nearby.

TV: (21.5)
I ↑think TV shows at least the ones that I’ve been watching have been getting better [laughs] frankly. Maybe I don’t watch the bad ones. (.7) Of ↑course I don’t because (.) I don’t like them right? Um ↑anyway there’s a lot of really good ones that I really like. Things like True Detective. I enjoyed (.) Fargo recently:. Um these ones that are more on the HBO model. Those are my favorites.

Veg: (25.0)
I think being a vegetarian is probably (.4) a pretty noble thing but it’s something that (.4) I (.3) don’t do currently. (.5) Um (.) a lot of (.) my friends are vegetarians. Some of them are vegan. (1.1) And I (.4) um (1.3) I ↑guess I try to be a little bit close to vegetarian but uh (.5) I still do- do eat meat.  A little less than other people.

Charlotte: 1 (29.0)
Uh: she should (.) probably: email everyone and tell them (.) that she got the ↑date wrong (.5). But ↑also (.3) leave a note on her door on Friday night (.) cause what if people show up and no one’s there? That would be very sad. (1.6) So um (.6) uh her ↑friends might be very mad at her once they’ve already planned to come on Friday but then they were going to come on Saturday instead. But (.6) um (.7) it’s: (1.1) ↑you know an honest mistake they’ll understand.

Charlotte 2: (20.6)
Uh: I ↑guess another way would be (.) to (.) move the (.3) party to Friday. (.8) Um (1.1) that might actually be easier (.) cause (.8). Well it depends on how much planning she put into this the Saturday date and how many people are know the Saturday date. But (.) that would be ↑another way to solve the problem obviously just cause just to hold the party on Friday cause everyone thinks it’s Friday but.

Charlotte 3: (24.3)
My ↑impression? (.6) Um: ↑Charlotte (1.1) ↑I sunno I don’t have much of an impression I think it’s pretty honest mistake anyone could do that. (2.8) Dunno I guess (.3) she’s probably not the most meticulous person in the world (.) but (1.3) um (2.2) y’know (1.5) I ↑think she’s a fine understanding person.

Gary 1: (27.6)
I ↑think Gary should (.6) apologize to (.3) Jane (.9) and: buy a new alarm clock. (.7) Or set his phone to go off so he’s not late ↑again. (1.5) cause it’s ↑inconsiderate. (2.0) And um [laughs] uh: it’s probably not the worst thing in the world because it was just a breakfast meet but um (.7) [clears throat] (.4) uh ↑it’s something he should probably avoid at least in the future.

Gary 2: (21.9)
Well computer I have already touched on this. Um (.) he ↑could get a new (1.0) um (.3) alarm clock (.8). Or he could go to bed ↑earlier or learn to use his cell phone with a (1.0) um (.3) alarm clock (.6) or he could not make (1.2) uh ↑appointments at times that he (.4) thinks he’s gonna sleep in (1.1) [laughs].

Gary 3: (31.9)
↑Well again I don’t think it’s (.) easy to form a full-fledged opinion from ↑this but (.6) ↑again also (.) um (.9) if (1.0) you: if this is a ↑regular pattern then (.7) Gary (.3) could be (.4) a little less considerate than other ↑people uh (1.3) if he knew he had an appointment he could’ve (.4) tried to take some steps to get there (.7) [clears throat] (1.4) but y’know Jane still seems to like him so (.5) I (.8) don’t have anything ↑really bad to say about George.

Jimmy 1: (21.3)
Well ↑it’s (.) not really (.3) supported by the evidence (.6) cause he had only gone one direction. (1.0) Um (.8) so (.) you know that (1.1) ↑ at least (1.9) it’s: you- you’ve ↑seen that (.4) sometimes when it’s raining it’s because there are clouds in the sky at least if you believe Dad.

Jimmy 2: (23.4)
Um through reasoned debate in the Socratic method (0.4) perhaps [laughs] (.3) like asking him (.7) um have you ever seen clouds in the sky (.4) when it’s not ↑raining? (.9) So what would that tell you about your (.) conclusion? (1.1) Um (.8) and it also talked a little bit about (.7) how um ↑even in the other direction it was a little bit off. (.3) Uh.

Jimmy 3: (27.8)
Um my impression is that he’s probably ↑young because his name is (.9) Jimmy? (.7) And he’s talking to his dad a lot about (.3) he doesn’t know why it ↑rains. (1.2) Um and therefore (1.1) I ↑don’t really have an impression as to his reasoning abilities cause uh I think everyone when they’re young has (.6) imperfect reasoning abilities (.9) so (1.1) think Jimmy’s a f- (1.5) fine young ↑man.


Group 1: Kat
Animal: (32.5)
The bravest animal. (1.5) Oh my god (.) that’s a really hard question. Are animals ↑brave? (.9) I get- I don’t even know what they are ↑brave. (.3) Because (1.5) brave implies that you’re you know (.4) getting your courage up and I don’t know if animals get their courage up. I feel like they (.7) are so (.3) naturally: (.9) intuitively (.) responding and ↑moving and doing (.4) maybe brave things all the time but I don’t know if I’d call it brave.

Leader: (38.5)
Well (.3) that’s a good question too. I’ve been thinking about that a lot. (2.4) Because there’s a lot of leadership required here. You know barristas and John and (.7) so what makes someone good a leader is (.3) I-I ↑think decisiveness is really important (.) in a leader. (.6) But I ↑also think emotional intelligence is also really important. Some leaders I’ve worked with also don’t have that. (.9) Um (.9) and ↑also a trust (.) I think. A trust in the goodness like (.) you know you’re gonna (.7) trust that somebody (1.2) is trying their best.

School: (25.0)
I ↑don’t know. What are the subjects in school? (1.2) Like (.) what (.) math? I mean I don’t ev-I don’t really know how they do school now. (.9) Math’s probably pretty hard. (2.2) Physics. (1.9) I-I ↑mean I don’t think there’s a hard uh I nuh I mun. (.7) Really analyze each question really. (.3) You know what it’s hard. (.) Everyone has a different one so (.) [unintelligible] (.) which is the hardest?

Second Lang: (29.5)
My ↑opinion is that (.3) it is good to learn a second language. (.6) And um (.) you know (.) uh (.) I wanna- Joe’s- I have a little five year old and I put him in like a Spanish immersion school like right when he was (.) cause I feel like it’s (.7) so ↑great to just like get that mind expanded and a second language is so hard to do- to learn. [laughs] I think for me it’s been really hard to learn a second language (.) doing it later. (1.1) But it’s so great. Great.

Space: (24.3)
I don’t know if I have a lot of ideas about space travel (.) in the future (.) um. (1.6) I don’t know. I don’t really care about that so much. I mean I think it’s cool but ↑I:- I’m more into like um (.9) inner (.7) space travel (.) [laughs] the consciousness. (.)You know like exploring like (.5) consciousness. (.6) Where consciousness can travel so like non-physical travel is more interesting to me.

Story: (28.7)
I mean not knowing how it ends. (.5) I guess. (.4) Um: (1.2) there’s always some kind of twist or something. (.7) Or ↑some detail. Or something- a story might may also like show you something (.4) that you never thought (.6) uh new or revealing (.4) or show you something that you know is ↑true that you haven’t thought (.) of before. (.7) Um (.) or it’s maybe about someone (.4) you’d like to be or you (.3) someone different from yourself or.

Summer: (23.4)
Hm: a good place to travels are- ↑I really like (1.0) I think it’s always great to go up north. You know people say “oh I’m going up north.” (.) You know to Michigan but um. (1.4) cause it’s beautiful up there and you wouldn’t want to go in the winter necessarily. (.)And beautiful lakes. Swimming in a lake is really (.4) the best. (1.6) And: (.6) now where else would you go in the summer.

TV: (22.8)
Current TV shows. I ↑don’t really -we don’t have a TV but we do watch TV on Netflix. I don’t think I’m really that into current TV shows except in this really filtered way. You know what’s Netflix have or amazon (.5) instant prime. (.) I guess that’s my experience with TV shows.

Veg: (32.7)
Well God I know that’s a big question. I was a vegetarian (.7) for a while and I still see myself as a low meat eater (.5) but I live with John Rousse. And every time I’ll just- I – cause I ↑don’t really know how to cook meat so I’ll just be- you know I mostly cook vegetarian but he’ll bring home a big chunk of like (.8) you know pork shoulder. All of a sudden we’re eating pork shoulder the whole week. (.8) So: what I well- so I ↑feel (.8) ah (.) I (.) feel I’m not always living up to my own ideal.


Group 2: William
Animal: (41.5)
The ↑bravest animal I would say would be a: (6.2) uh: [laughs] I’ll just say the ↑hawk because they are- there-there’s not too many of them and you know despite being a predatory species they have to it-it-it-it-it-its actually very difficult for them to hunt for food and I think for example in contrast being a grazing animal like a ↑cow they don’t really do much they’re- there’s just grass everywhere in front of them but for something like a ↑hawk they have to be- they have to venture out very f- very long distances in search of food and to support their ((young)).

Leader: (29.5)
↑Confidence and: respect. A good leader doesn’t necessarily mean they always make good decisions it’s they’re a good leader because they inspire they have a lot of confidence which inspires respect so that people ↑follow them. And obviously you know there is some baseline level of decision making skills but in my opinion I think the vast majority of what makes a good leader is definitely confidence.

School: (31.9)
Uh: in my opinion the hardest school subject would probably be something that is (2.6) ↑memorization based in my opinion just because uh that’s uh I guess something that I was always ↑weak at and just because there’s no there’s no uh: (0.9) there’s always it’s really easy to fall into a pattern you know when you memorize either words or subjects or topics it’s very easy to just follow ((to)) for your brain to always categorize them as the same ↑subject and when that happens you just kind of get everything just kind of gets ((when it)) mixed up.

Second Lang: (37.5)
I think ↑everyone should learn a second language or more if possible because I’m of the belief that being more ↑cultured in general which is a consequence of learning a second language is very helpful towards a person’s (1.1) overall intellectual well-being. (1.1) And uh: that’s: that’s: (1.3) [laughs] it [laughs] and: (1.5) ↑furthermore it’s just I think a g- it allows better globalization in the sense that people are more able to communicate with each other instead of being isolated in their own communities.

Space: (21.0)
I’m ↑I’m personally very passionate about that topic because I think it is a necessary future for humanity. Whether people have like whatever opinions people have of it I think it is absolutely necessary because this planet is not in its current form at the rate that the population is increasing and the rate that we’re using ↑energy it is not sustainable for us to stay on this planet indefinitely as a human species.

Story: (27.4)
A story is interesting in my opinion when it’s not cliché or: (1.5) boring: but that’s not a very descriptive word so what I mean by cliché is: (1.4) if it’s easily predictably you know you’ve seen this story before or some variation of it if it’s ↑not cliché it’s very ↑unique it inspires deep thought and uh: (1.2) inspiration and uh so and so forth [laughs].

Summer: (22.6)
↑My favorite place to travel in the summer would be somewhere very outdoor- that has a very outdoor destination. For example a few years ago I went up to ↑Canada to this place called ↑Banff national park and I thought it was just the most gorgeous place in the world and I loved hiking through it: absorbing the-the sights, getting away from people and just enjoying nature in general.

TV: (26.6)
↑I think they’re a total waste of time because I’m not engaged in any TV show and I kind of see them as just kind of mindless blabber for the ↑masses [laughs]. I mean right now you have like mostly like reality TV shows: or comedies: ↑comedies could be interesting because you know if they’re you know they make me laugh but reality TV shows I just do not see the: (1.3) uh I do not see why they’re interesting at ((all)).

Veg: (27.2)
I am not a vegetarian (0.9) but if I ↑were I: (1.4) my opinion would be: that (1.8) I’m doing it for: ↑health benefits and: ↑ethical benefits. As in (1.3) in ↑general eating vegetables and fruit is considered healthy if you I mean if you’re not exercising all the time if you just get the ((necessarily)) calories and nutrients that’s enough.

Charlotte 1: (20.2)
(0.9) She: should ↑contact all of her friends and tell them that the date was a mistake and that the party isn’t actually on Saturday. And she should probably do it in the most ↑timely way possible preferably by texting or phone call so that they get the message as soon as possible (1.2).

Charlotte 2: (22.4)
Another way for her to solve this ↑problem I suppose would be to: (1.9) for example if this was a party involving a lot of ↑people and the setup isn’t too extravagant she should probably just change it to Friday↑ then (0.9) as to not inconvenience that many people [laughs].

Charlotte 3: (26.3)
Uh she: is not a very organized ↑person. Although everyone makes mistakes setting up an event like that you have to make sure to be as careful as ↑possible because I mean you’re involving other people in this and they’ve already- they have schedules and time commitments and uh for any kind of social large social event you should be as prepared as possible.

Gary 1: (37.9)
He should ↑apologize to Jane in person preferably and not over the phone or text message because that seems a bit of a more of a personal touch and to say that I’m deeply sorry that I missed the ↑breakfast I mean that I ↑overslept and I will make it up to you somehow (3.1). And: (1.1) uh: (2.3) again he should uh he should be very ↑curt and short in his apology because no one wants to hear a long winded apology [laughs].

Gary 2 (30.2)
By: (1.2) being a more disciplined person because (1.6) although again everyone makes ↑mistakes but (1.0) only with discipline you make less of them. For example making sure he sets his ↑alarm clock and not going to bed too late when you have to wake up really early the next morning for breakfast (1.6). And: (1.9) uh: (0.9) just being a more organized person.

Gary 3: (34.0)
Uh: my ↑impression of him is that (1.8) uh: he is (1.3) someone who well just based on this one fact about him and again you should never [laughs] make conclusions about a person ba- just based on one mistake but if I ↑had to I would say that he is a very ↑sloppy and lazy person who sleeps in and does not take his commitments seriously (1.5). And in the ↑future he should again be more disciplined.

Jimmy 1: (37.8)
I think it is a valid ↑conclusion based on what his dad told him. His dad specifically said if it only rains when there are clouds in the sky well naturally to a little kid who isn’t (1.2) completely ↑educated on the subject naturally take that (1.1) you know as a: as dogma (2.5). And uh: (1.9) [laughs] (4.4) Jimmy could perhaps be more ↑inquisitive and ask his dad.

Jimmy 2: (29.8)
By being by elaborating a little bit more on exactly when it rains for example just saying when there are ↑clouds it is only one criteria for there to be rain. He could perhaps say: (1.1) not a there are several conditions required for there to be rain clouds is just one of them. Other could be for example how ↑humid it is outside or: how ↑thick the clouds are or: the temperature and a variety of other- other factors.

Jimmy 3: (39.3)
He is a ↑normal ↑kid and is very curious and I think that is very for ↑any kid being curious and asking questions is a very good trait to have in a kid because it just shows that they’re curious and curiosity is always a: good (0.9) trait to have in a person (6.6). And Jimmy: (1.5) [laughs] (4.5) Jimmy uh can [laughs] uh I don’t have any other opinions.


Group 2: Betsy
Animal: (20.5)
 (.3) I ↑think all animals are brave (1.6) because (4.6) they’re all they ↑can (.4) yeah (.) anim- all animals are brave just cause they have their own (1.0) aggressive (.3) nature to survive. (1.2) Oh (.) um;.

Leader: (24.9)
I ↑guess (EM) a good leader is really (.) dominant (1.0) expressive. (2.3) I don’t know (1.2) like if he seems really ↑honest (.) (1.2) I guess (DM) (1.1) because (.4) those ↑traits are important cause (.) I guess (DM) it’ll lets people put their trust in you. (.8) So: (.) (DIR) that’s how you’re able to lead people.

School: (22.8)
Uh it’s always been English cause (.6) just it was a ↑second language. Well now it’s my first language but (.8) no one ever really taught me (.6) formal English. It’s something I just acquired on my own. (1.0) And I really didn’t understand grammar until (.) SAT in high school which is kind of depressing to admit.

Second lang: (24.6)
I think ↑learning a second language is really important (.) because  (.7) it (.9) brings in ↑knowledge about-learning about other ↑cultures and stuff (.) and (DIR) it’s really good skill to have (1.2) to: do (.) work (.) and just any (.) I don’t know (.4) and (.9) um (2.3) I just have to keep talking right?

Space: (25.4)
Space traveling is: (1.2) never really thought much about space travelling but (.6) I ↑think (EM) it’s something that (.6) people should definitely look into cause (1.2) the world itself is more than just ↑Earth. I don’t know I just (.4) interesting to know (.3) what’s out there than just (2.0) humans on like planet.

Story: (28.1)
(DIR) An interesting story is something that’s never: (.9) like an idea that hasn’t been written (.8) um (1.7) interesting plotline (1.4) with unusual characters (1.0) fascinating. (.7) Well ↑everyone has different tastes so (DIR) it’s (.4) whatever sparks your own interests so (1.7) yeah. (1.5) Yeah (.4) don’t really have a really strong opinion on that.

Summer: (26.4)
I don’t have an opinion on this. (.) It’s just wherever you want to go. Wherever you want to go during the summer then (DIR) that’s a good place to travel. (1.7) Okay (.4) um: (3.3) it’s ↑just exploring so wherever you have a good time (DIR) that’s a good place to go during the summer. (.9) Um: (3.3) like for me I wanna go to Japan.

TV: (19.9)
Um: (.8) I ↑think (EM) (.)↑television is pretty bad (.5) I ↑think (EM) it’s (.) overly exaggerated (.4) kind of boring. (.9) (DIR) It’s really redundant. (2.1) And I ↑feel like (EM) it’s just like American thing so can’t get used to it. (2.0) Um:.

Veg: (22.2)
If it’s religious (.5) it’s fine (1.4) but if you’re doing it to be a part of like- (1.7) but (.4) I don’t know I don’t understand why diets trend (.5) and like being vegetarian or like vegan right now is like trendy and it makes people feel healthier. (.6) If ↑It’s for that reason then you’re kind of stupid.

Charlotte 1 (20.4)
 (DIR) Call all her friends (.) and (DIR) be like (.) “yes it’s actually on Saturday (.) and I messed up.” (1.2) So (.) and if it doesn’t work for you (.3) people than just reschedule it. (1.0) But then again I don’t think that’s a big deal I guess. I don’t really have (2.4) oh god [laughs] n- okay no.

Charlotte 2: (20.9)
Other than make a Facebook event and tell her friends. (.7) or like call them (.6) or send another invitation. (2.5) make ↑another event? (1.5) During another time than when those options work (1.1) so everyone can go? I don’t know. I ↑feel like I already said all the other options.

Charlotte 3: (19.8)
She seems (.) kind of: (.7) clumsy:. (1.2) Like if ↑I were to do an invitation I would (.) proofread everything just to double check. (1.1) Um (.6) but (DIR) that’s okay. (1.2) It was a mistake. (1.1) She (.) might have gotten the days mixed up or something.

Gary 1: (25.9)
Gary should just apologize (.) and (.9) re-plan the ate (.7) I guess (.7). Wait was that what the story was? (.) Okay yeah. Just ↑making sure. (1.1) (DIR) Just say sorry:. (1.5) slept through and came ((hwacha)) later. (1.1) And (2.6) I mean it’s a ↑pretty reasonable: (.5) excuse?

Gary 2: (21.2)
I mean (.) assumingly that he feels (.6) bad about ↑it (.) it probably won’t really happen again. (.9) Cause Gary’s probably a good guy and learned his lesson. (1.2) So (1.8) it probably won’t happen. But if it does happen (.) I don’t know set like five alarms. (1.2) Continuous alarms.

Gary 3: (20.6)
I don’t ↑have an impression because this is just a made up scenario. (.7) But (.) he just seems like a normal kid that just kind of messed up? (.9) It’s an accident not a big deal. (.9) S-slept in (.) (DIR) It’s normal. We all want to sleep in. (1.0) Yup. (.6) Um (1.4) it’s just a movie.

Jimmy 1: (22.9)
 (.) Well the first thing I thought of (.) was this (1.3) the thing I learned from psych (1.2) [laughs] winter quarter (.5) where this like conditioning (.8) yourself (.3) It’s like a dog right? When like a bell rings (.3) they think that they get a treat and in Jimmy’s case (1.3) it’s like (.3) cloudy thinks it’s gonna rain.

Jimmy 2: (21.7)
Nature doesn’t work that ↑way? (.5) Just because it’s cloudy doesn’t mean that it rains. (1.7) Um probably take him out on a day when it’s cloudy and it’s not raining. (1.3) Reconditions his thinking. (1.1) Um (2.3) show him some scenes from Animal Planet [laughs].

Jimmy 3: (32.3)
He can be 4 years old. (.7) really young (.8) doesn’t understand anything (.4) and he reminds me of the kids that come into my work. (.) It’s kind of frustrating (2.4) like (1.0) um (3.7) just (0.4) hard to deal with (.9) and kinda (1.3) clueless. I mean all kids are.


Group 2: Hong
Charlotte 1: (31.9)
[Laughs] only thing that make up directly call the person who she ↑invited and tell them all she got the wrong date the correct date uh to see who can still catch the time. If the more person uh: involved then he can- she can- Charlotte can send ↑e-mail or text message.

Charlotte 2: (28.6)
Uh Charlotte kind of needs just to call her friends and say ↑hey I- I made a mistake I got the wrong date can- can you please come on Saturday instead of Friday? I ↑think Charlotte’s friends were don’t mind about that and Charlotte maybe next time will just uh make a note to ↑do it carefully to read. She’ll be fine it’s no big deal it’s just wrong date and time.

Charlotte 3: (32.1)
↑Charlotte is a girl who looks not very careful about some detail and the small things but uh it- it’s not a very big huge deal uh Charlotte is kind of like ↑maybe she’s already doing some multitask at the same ↑time but she just missed the date and really hurried to send something out uh but Charlotte maybe kind of slow down a little bit but that is life just [tape error].

Gary 1: (26.7)
Uh ↑Gary I think if I was Gary I think the alarm because [laughs] he told me the breakfast at eight I don’t want to sleep past the hour and miss the breakfast so they either think- ↑think an ↑alarm on a phone or on the clock so I don’t miss the time and I can go to the breakfast ↑before eight.

Gary 2: (24.5)
((Theater)) I think the first thing remember: the- the time of he can do put some notes on a calendar um or he can do are when he received the messages to go ahead to the alarm to set alarm then the next morning he won’t miss that because sometimes we do something maybe he just ↑forgot about that.

Gary 3: (22.2)
Gary is who missed uh the time uh I think Gary is kind of like a not a very detailed ↑person uh it seems like he just not very detail-oriented organized. ↑Maybe he needed to be more ↑organized about his stuff so he won’t forget something.

Jimmy 1: (21.7)
I don’t think ↑this is the ((technically)) the best answer about Jim’s conclusion because there’s a different ↑situation if you see the clouds in the sky. It number one it ↑could be rain it would cause the- the more the- the cumulous the big enough to make the rain but sometimes you have clouds that it won’t rain just.

Jimmy 2: (22.8)
↑Jimmy’s father can um say some kind of different condition to ↑Jimmy to told him [recording error] there’s not only one answer conclusion come from the clouds in the sky for example the clouds the make sunshine go away you still feel cool but it’s not ↑raining sometimes there ↑could be rain.

Jimmy 3: (17.4)
Uh ↑Jimmy is a ↑kid and I think it’s not surprising because sometimes kids only see one um the- the situation then they just thinking one conclusion. It’s ↑normal Jimmy just a little kid but he can learn something.


Group 3: Menmen
Animal: (30.7)
Uh maybe the ↑bravest animal is a: (1.2) um [laughs] it’s a ↑tiger or a ↑lion I’m not so sure about this but I think the most bravest animal should be the a wild ones because they are never trained in the ↑zoo and they maybe they would adjust to the wild life very ↑naturally and uh maybe they would prey for their uh prey for the other animals for food.

Leader: (29.5)
I think a good ↑leader should be more or less ambitious. He would uh know uh what he wants to do and uh and what’s more he would he- he should know that what he can ↑how can he do it so it’s uh usually uh a successful ↑leader is a smart ↑guy and uh he can attract- he can attracts many people to focus on him and.

School: (25.4)
For ↑me the hardest school subject is chemistry because I can ↑it is too hard for me but just from the personal point of ↑view because I just think that it’s too ↑hard uh I don’t know how to say it but chemistry is uh is-is-is-is-is more uh ↑complicated and challenging for me than other subjects.

Second Lang: (24.9)
Uh for me learning a second language is a very uh ↑basical thing for a and it’s necessary for society because uh you know that nowadays in ↑China or in the world English is very ↑important and a ↑second language can help different areas and countries to uh communicate directly with each other.

Space: (24.7)
↑I think space travel in the ↑future will be more and more prevalent than nowadays because of the uh- uh science and technology scientific and technological development um the ↑I heard that uh: ↑nowadays people can send the uh ashes of the dead people to the um the outer space.

Story: (32.5)
Uh a very interesting ↑story I think uh it would present some tensions and it needs a very uh ↑interesting and exciting plot to attract people to uh have the intention or have the curiosity to uh keep on reading the story and until the final- f- uh until the final part of it (1.4) um uh ↑to me the most interesting story may be the mysteries.

Summer: (32.0)
I think the best place uh for travelling summer is uh- uh the- the ↑beach because we can see the ↑sea and the- the ↑sand and the maybe coconut ↑trees it’s just a very Hawaii thing I think and (1.7) yeah and but I have never been to a very ↑fancy uh beach but I uh look forward to going ↑there because I like swimming.

TV: (33.1)
Uh I think ↑current TV shows uh they uh in order to try to attracts more and more audience they would some uh improper elements such as ↑violent and ↑sexual or very dangerous things into it to attract uh people to watch these- to watch these TV shows but I think it is not very good for the development of the society especially for the-the-the-the development of the children and.

Veg: (35.5)
Hmm I think um ↑it would be more health it’s a- it’s a more healthy way to eat food if you are a vegetarian but um ↑it depends maybe because in China if you are ↑Buddhist then you are a vegetarian so there many people have the prejudices towards vegetarian people because they think they would uh be uh they would be a ↑religious one or something like that but uh ↑I’d like to I ↑really want to try this kind of uh kind of way of eating food.

Charlotte 1: (26.8)
Mm: I think Charlotte should um if he has sent the invitations ↑already he should uh inform all the guests and friends to correct the date and time of the ↑party to avoid their uh avoid inconveniences yeah and ↑if he did not send invitations she can correct it as soon as possible.

X Charlotte 2: (9.6)

Charlotte 3: (24.0)
Uh I think ↑Charlotte is more or less careless about the arrangements. Maybe he is a very- is not a very ↑careful guy and uh um yeah but it’s fortunate ↑fortunately that she has found it before this party so there’s a chance an opportunity for her to correct it.

Gary 1: (27.8)
Uh I think Gary should firstly apologize to Jen and explain that ↑why she he would do that uh to uh then Jen can forgive Gary for that and uh: ↑I think maybe next time Gary should invite Jen again to uh dinner or uh yeah to some ↑restaurants and.

Gary 2: (18.5)
↑He [laughs] should uh remember his experience and try to avoid such circumstance uh next ↑time and I think Jen can tell ↑Gary what he could do and [recording error] to speak.

Gary 3: (20.9)
↑I think it’s understandable that if you sleep uh sleep too- too ↑late because maybe the last night Gary do a lot of homeworks and something like that but uh: the it depends on the his behavior in the next time and it depends on his ↑action towards this kind of circumstances.

Jimmy 1: (30.6)
Mm I think ↑Jimmy is generalized or is generalizing all the circumstances and ↑but uh if Jimmy is a ↑child or a ↑teenager it is understandable because of his ↑dad’s uh did not uh didn’t do very well to teach him that how did it rain or explain the theory of the weather condition.

Jimmy 2: (34.9)
[Laughs] He can ↑explain it to Jimmy again and tell her- told him that uh maybe uh not every time it is cloudy that it will ↑rain it’s cloudy just because it’s cloudy because it’s not sunny [laughs] yeah (0.9) ↑and: he can try to explain that why it would rain correctly and tell him that every time you meet this situation you should not to should not generalize all the conditions.

Jimmy 3: (32.6)
What is the impression of Jimmy? I think ↑Jimmy is um: (3.0) I don’t know it depends on Jimmy’s ↑age. If he’s an ↑adult I think he’s too uh too quick to make a decision or make a connection between uh two things or two conditions and there’s something to correct about Jimmy’s opinions or his behavior his habits of thinking about things and ((related)) things.


Group 3: Yujiyang
Animal: (18.2)
I think it must be a ↑tiger because- because a ↑ ((mountain)) can’t- can’t be with two tiger- two tiger and um a tiger is very very ((scary)) I think so I think it’s tiger is the brave- bravest animals in the nation.

Leader: (25.3)
I think a great- great communicator with others make a good leader because if- if you- if you want to a good lea- a good leader you must have- have a very very good and deep relationships with each other and you can- you can build team and do something- something one- one people- one person ↑can’t do it.

School: (32.1)
I think- I think for me it’s English because ((after I stopped taking my)) in no it’s teached by English and I- I must to learn ↑many many English so I think English is very difficult for me now um uh: ↑calc- calculus you know I think calculus is difficult but teach calculus ↑by English [laughs] is much difficult.

Second Lang: (30.9)
I think learning a second language is quite difficult it’s quite difficult but I should try my best to learn- learn it like um I think ↑I like- I like German very much but I think it’s too difficult to me. It’s very very uh I have I have ↑tried to learn it before but I failed uh I can speak some- some ↑Japanese.

Space: (24.9)
Jules Verne I think is a- is a- is a he write a ↑novel and I read it times by times many- many times uh and I think space traveling will be ↑popular in the future and everyone can go to- go to space and see the planets sun or in- into the sun. I think it’s cool.

X Story: ()

Summer (27.7)
I think it’s a- it’s a small- small town in the ((Shitai)). It’s- it’s next to the- it’s next to the ↑Shanghai uh a river through this town and it’s very very old has a ((very solemn view)) more of ↑more of us all the year history so I have been there this summer- summer occasion some holiday so I think ((Shitai)) is a very good place to travel in summer.

TV: (21.5)
I think it- it make it can make me: it can make me life interesting and ↑colorful. It’s: it’s: it’s kind of my life. I watch it with my family and we chat and it can improve our- our ↑relationships.

Veg: (24.6)
I think it’s a ((call)) [sighs] I ↑can’t do this and I- I’m a meat-eater [laughs] uh only eat vegetables can leave some ↑illnesses in ((poor)) but- but it’s depend on their ↑belief or some- some ((call))- some belief.

Charlotte: 1 (26.1)
Uh she I think she had to prepare for the party what ↑whenever it will- it will be held and- and just do what- ↑what he can do and just wait um so if- if you can- can- can ((appear)) this is the story.

Charlotte 2: (32.1)
I think he if ↑he: if she- if she want to hold a big party I think he should send invitations to his friend and his- his ↑classmates and change- change another place to carry this party and uh and prepare for- for all the thing he could do and just have fun.

Charlotte 3: (32.2)
I think he is a- he is a not- not a very smart girl and he should guessed he should seen this- this ↑problem and try- try to solve the problem and: and he can- he ↑can: can- he can- he can try something to- to throw the- throw the party when he- when she want- when she want and that’s it so.

Gary 1: (23.1)
He eat breakfast [laughs] quick- ↑quickly as he can and go to- go to school do something um do something he- he should- he should do and he- he’s late- he’s late for some- some- for something and:  his friend is very [laughs] offended.

Gary 2: (26.0)
He should have set a: he should have asked his- his friend to get up ↑early and ask- ask him to get up early too and maybe his ↑mother his father can call- call him if- if he doesn’t- he doesn’t can get up himself and: if he may have a ↑phone.

Gary 3: (16.8)
[Laughs] I think he’s so- he’s so ↑stupid and he is someone- someone with for ↑him and someone- some- someone may be ↑angry or- or maybe have a bad impression on him so I think it’s very very stupid.

Jimmy 1: (22.1)
I think he’s right. I think clouds with- with- with ↑rain if many clouds are- are in the sky actually it- it refers to rain no- no not refers it will- it will- ↑it will lead to rain.

Jimmy 2: (21.3)
Uh I think his father can ↑show him when there’s- when there’s cloud in- in the sky it then it’s not rain. I think his father can show him- can show him one thing his father can show him was this and: I think that’s all.

Jimmy 3: (30.2)
It’s very cute. He- he’s [laughs] very cute and I think he’s a ↑little boy and study- s- studying in grade- gray- grade one or grade two. He didn’t- didn’t learn some- some about climate uh: [laughs] um he is I- I think he- he- he is cute.


Group 3: Yanan
Animal: (52.5)
Maybe- maybe ↑dog is the bravest animal I think mm you know dog- dogs mm help being (0.9) dog- dogs help rescued many peoples in the ↑fire uh it will it- it- it means that dogs be on not it- it’s ↑not fear the ((latent)) (1.5) risks the ((answer)) and it will (1.3) mm do something to help with to mm its (4.0) uh its- its families I think.

Leader: (42.0)
I think that a- a good leader must know ↑all the works of his or her mm ↑participants [laughs] uh and he or she should help them when they have some troubles in work or and be mm tolerant- ↑tolerant [laughs] or and mm he- he should (0.9) mm (1.0) should- he- he↑shouldn’t blame on them too much.

School: (47.0)
I- I never touched the subjects like or (0.9) uh (1.7) so I first I should investigate some mm (0.9) the (1.2) uh (1.4) ↑knowledge about this subject and then I will mm ask some- somebody like my classmates or others to help me. I think it’s a- a great- a great and- a great job and it- it’s got be- ↑beyond [laughs] my abilities so I think it’s- it- it’s hard to me and but- but I will try and challenge and try my best to do it.

Second Lang: (33.7)
Um I think it- it’s a good- it’s a ↑very good mm (1.1) it’s a very good idea and uh and (1.2) mm very liked to learn a second language like this English even- even though my English is just so-so and I- I hope I can learn I- I can speak English much fluently in the future and I can uh keep in touch with something like in keep in touch with someone like in- in a foreign country.

Space: (50.7)
Um I ↑think: and- and- and more as I see the mm of the find- the findings of (1.0) uh ↑water or something like water in- in uh in another planet but not Earth I think it’s- it’s- it’s ↑possible that we- we can go there in the future in some- something like space- space flight or something like uh (1.0) mm the ↑train or some or- or even- even a bus and we can- we can still some (1.5) mm like a transportation or.

Story: (63.4)
Mm I think that uh it’s the it’s- it’s- it’s (0.9) the ↑people who tells- tell- tells [laughs] the story is very important and he or she or something interesting um with uh interesting ((choice)) and we can maybe all we will be attracted by him or- by him or her and the next is the- the ↑content of the story and your be and it should be: (1.3) uh: (1.5) it should be (1.0) um (3.1) mm I ↑mean that different people like children or teenager adult- adult you should hear listen to different stories.

Summer: (42.2)
The is the mm the place like the (1.4) ↑ ((Tibet)) um maybe not the exact name [laughs] but you know I- I think uh the- the firstly is ↑weather is very okay to there in summer because and the clouds are all mm white and the ↑sky is blue and what can I say many mm residents there and many and we- we can know their ↑cultures.

TV: (37.9)
Uh I’m actually I don’t like the (1.2) ↑ ((anger)) I- I don’t know- no I need a TV show start just many handsome- handsome ↑boys and beautiful girls I don’t like them and I don’t- I don’t think they act very real uh I and ↑now the mm the movies are mm more progressing on actions the future knowledges I ((appear for it)).

Veg: (31.4)
Actually (1.8) I- I like eating meat ↑very much [laughs] so I- I can (1.6) mm (1.2) um can’t understand them very much so but- but I- I respect them. I think it’s just opinion being in our life and maybe some mm days maybe in some days I will be a vegetarian [laughs].
